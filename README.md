# craft_it

BootCamp project. craft_it app is two applications in one You can log in as a Customer to buy stuff or as a Store owner to sell your own goods

## Getting Started

To test the app make sure that you set up the backend correctly
change the IP address in baseUrl in craft_it\lib\core\constants\api_constants.dart to your IP address if you're testing with a physical device make sure both your PC and that device are connected to the same internet

unfortunately, the register screen won't work so make an account using Postman this hopefully will make it easier for you https://craft-it-6783.postman.co/workspace/Craft-it-Workspace~aae99cbd-e08d-4c45-acc0-eca5ef9d1127/collection/12028719-9133cc4d-4881-4425-b147-1549fa06edf3?action=share&creator=12028719 and once you log in nothing will show so be sure to fill your database to see it all

Best of luck
